# Emblem Editor Expanded & Enhanced

###### Installation as Tampermonkey user-script:

I recommend this installation method because once it's installed you won't need to deal with code anymore.

- Create a new Tampermonkey script and paste the source from
[emblem-editor-expanded-enhanced.js](emblem-editor-expanded-enhanced.js) into it.

- Then navigate to an existing emblem or a new emblem in Social Club.

###### Run with no installation:

- Alternatively, navigate to an existing emblem or a new emblem in Social Club.

- Copy the code in [emblem-editor-expanded-enhanced.js](emblem-editor-expanded-enhanced.js)

- Paste it in the Javascript console (F12) and press Enter to execute the code.
